# Final Project for Bioinformatics using ProgessiveCactus to create an assembly hub with Yeast and Mosquito genomes

The yeast genomes were downloaded from: <l>ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/users/dmc/yeast/latest/cere_assemblies.tgz<br>

The Anophelin genomes can be downloaded from Vectorbase:<br>
<l>https://www.vectorbase.org/download/anopheles-arabiensis-dongolacontigsaarad1fagz<br>
<l>https://www.vectorbase.org/download/anopheles-gambiae-pestchromosomesagamp4fagz<br>

The other two genomes were generated by me and will be used in a publication we are drafting.<br>

The link to the assembly hubs are located at:<br>

<br>
<br>

The root shared data is located <l>https://hpc.oit.uci.edu/~solarese/<br>
two folders are located there containing yeast and mosquito data<br>
<l>https://hpc.oit.uci.edu/~solarese/YeastHub<br>
<l>https://hpc.oit.uci.edu/~solarese/MosquitoHub<br>

The mosquito assembly data can also be downloaded from the MosquitoHub/asm folder along with the annotation data<br>
